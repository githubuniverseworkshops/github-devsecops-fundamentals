This self-paced workshop introduces learners to the fundamentals of DevSecOps
using GitHub.

For teams at the start of their DevSecOps journey, the workshop addresses the
following key concerns:

- _How do I align the quest for high velocity delivery with the goals and
  visions of my organization?_
- _How do I efficiently develop a project and manage code?_
- _How do I securely package artifacts and store them for distribution?_
- _How do I securely deploy artifacts/packages?_
- _How do I automate business processes?_

For the teams who are further along in their DevSecOps journey, this workshop
provides guidance and challenges you to reduce complications and streamline
developer workflows:

- _How do I consolidate tools and remove complications due to tool-bloat?_
- _How do I simplify the software supply chain process?_

This workshop is intended for the benefit of any audience who has interest in
addressing the above concerns.
