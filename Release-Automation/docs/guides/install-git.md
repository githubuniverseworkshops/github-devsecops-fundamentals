# Install Git

How to install Git on any OS

Git can be installed on the most common operating systems like Windows, Mac, and
Linux. In fact, Git comes installed by default on most Mac and Linux machines!

## Checking for Git

To see if you already have Git installed, open up your terminal application.

- If you're on a Mac, look for a command prompt application called "Terminal".
- If you're on a Windows machine, open the windows command prompt or "Git Bash".

Once you've opened your terminal application, type `git version`. The output
will either tell you which version of Git is installed, or it will alert you
that `git` is an unknown command. If it's an unknown command, read further and
find out how to install Git.

## Install Git Using GitHub Desktop

Installing GitHub Desktop will also install the latest version of Git if you
don't already have it. With GitHub Desktop, you get a command-line version of
Git with a robust GUI. Regardless of if you have Git installed or not, GitHub
Desktop offers a simple collaboration tool for Git. You can

   [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/) and download the
