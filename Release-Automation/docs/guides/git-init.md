# `git init`

```bash
git init
```

## What Does `git init` Do?

`git init` is one way to start a new project with Git. To start a repository,
use either `git init` or `git clone` â€“ not both.

To initialize a repository, Git creates a hidden directory called `.git`. That
directory stores all of the objects and refs that Git uses and creates as a part
of your project's history. This hidden `.git` directory is what separates a
regular directory from a Git repository.

## How to Use `git init`

- `git init`: Transform the current directory into a Git repository
- `git init <directory>`: Transform a directory in the current path into a Git
  repository
- `git init --bare`: Create a new bare repository (a repository to be used as a
  remote repository only, that won't contain active development)

You can see all of the options with `git init` in
[git-scm's documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init).

## Examples of `git init`

### `git init` vs `git clone`

Starting a new project can be confusing. Sometimes, it's unclear if you should
use `git init`, `git clone`, or both.

### `git init`: One Person Starting a New Repository Locally

Your project may already exist locally, but it doesn't have Git yet. `git init`
is probably the right choice for you. This is only run once, even if other
collaborators share the project.

- First, initialize the repository.
- Once you have initialized the repository, create a remote repository somewhere
  like GitHub.com.
- Then, add the remote URL to your local git repository with
  `git remote add origin <URL>`. This stores the remote URL under a more
  human-friendly name, `origin`.
- Shape your history into at least one commit by using `git add` to stage the
  existing files, and `git commit` to make the snapshot.
- Once you have at least one commit, you can push to the remote and set up the
  tracking relationship for good with `git push -u origin main`.

### `git clone`: The Remote Already Exists

If the repository already exists on a remote, you would choose to `git clone`
and _not_ `git init`.

If you create a remote repository first with the intent of moving your project
to it later, you may have a few other steps to follow. If there are no commits
in the remote repository, you can follow the steps above for `git init`. If
there are commits and files in the remote repository but you would still like it
to contain your project files, `git clone` that repository. Then, move the
project's files into that cloned repository. `git add`, `git commit`, and
`git push` to create a history that makes sense for the beginning of your
project. Then, your team can interact with the repository without `git init`
again.

### `git init` Existing Folder

The default behavior of `git init` is to transform the current directory into a
Git repository. For an existing project to become a Git repository, navigate
into the targeted root directory. Then, run `git init`.

Or, you can create a new repository in a directory in your current path. Use
`git init <directory>` and specify which directory to turn into a Git
repository.

## `git init` Gone Wrong

### `git init` in the wrong directory

Running `git init` in the wrong place will create unintended repositories. You
may have noticed strange error messages when using Git. Maybe you suspect that
another parent directory is also a Git repository.

To fix this, you first need to track down which directory is the unintended
repository. Use `git status` to see if the current directory is tracked by Git.
If it is, you can either run `ls -al` and look for an otherwise hidden `.git`
directory.

If you don't see it, navigate one level up in the directory structure with
`cd ..`. Use `git status` again in combination with `ls -al`. Repeat this until
you find the `.git` directory.

Once you find the `.git` directory, and you are sure that you don't want that to
be a Git repository, use `rm -rf .git`. This will remove the `.git` directory,
effectively un-initializing that repository. Run `git status` again to confirm
that Git is no longer tracking any of these files. (It could be possible that
multiple layers of `.git` directories are present.)

Return to your working repository, the one that you _expect_ to be under version
control. Things should be working as expected.

## Related

- `git clone [url]`: Clone (download) a repository that already exists on
  GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits.
- `git status`: Always a good idea, this command shows you what branch you're
  on, what files are in the working or staging directory, and any other
  important information.
- `git remote -v`: Show the associated remote repositories and their stored
  name, like `origin`.
- `git remote add origin <url>`: Add a remote so you can collaborate with others
  on a newly initialized repository.
- `git push`: Uploads all local branch commits to the remote.
- `git push -u origin main`: When pushing a branch for the first time, this type
  of push will configure the relationship between the remote and your local
  repository so that you can use `git pull` and `git push` with no additional
  options in the future.
