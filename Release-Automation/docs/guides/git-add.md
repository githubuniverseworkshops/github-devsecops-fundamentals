  The `git add` command adds new or changed files in your working directory to
  the Git staging area.

# `git add`

```bash
git add README.md
```

Without the `git add` command, no `git commit` would ever do anything.
Sometimes, `git add` can have a reputation for being an unnecessary step in
development. But in reality, `git add` is an important and powerful tool.
`git add` allows you to shape history without changing how you work.

## When should you `git add`?

As you're working, you may change and save a file, or multiple files. Before you
commit, you must `git add`. This step allows you to choose what you are going to
commit. Commits should be logical, atomic units of change â€“ but not everyone
works that way. Maybe you are making changes to files that _aren't_ logical or
atomic units of change. `git add` allows you to systematically shape your
commits and your history anyway.

## What does `git add` do?

`git add [filename]` selects a file and moves it to the staging area, marking it
for inclusion in the next commit. You can select all files, a directory,
specific files, or even specific parts of a file for staging.

This means if you `git add` a deleted file the _deletion_ is staged for commit.
The language of "add" when you're actually "deleting" can be confusing. If you
think or use `git stage` in place of `git add`, the reality of what is happening
may be more clear.

Both `git add` and `git commit` go together. They don't work when they aren't
used together and they both work best when used thinking of their joint
functionality.

## How do you use `git add`?

| Command          | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `git add <path>` | Stage a specific directory or file             |
| `git add -A`     | Stage all files not listed in the `.gitignore` |
| `git add -p`     | Interactively stage hunks of changes           |

You can see all of the many options for `git add` in
[git-scm documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add).

## Examples of `git add`

`git add` usually fits into the workflow in the following steps:

1. Create a branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b update-readme
   ```

1. Change a file or files
1. Save the file or files
1. Add the files or segments of code that should be included in the next commit

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```

1. Commit the changes

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add contributing links to README"
   ```

1. Push the changes to the remote branch

   ```bash
   git push -u origin update-readme
   ```

But, `git add` could also be used like:

1. Create a branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b update-readme
   ```

1. Change a file or files
1. Save the file or files
1. Add only one file, or one part of the changed file

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```

1. Commit the first set of changes

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add contributing links to README"
   ```

1. Add another file, or another part of the changed file

   ```bash
   git add CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```

1. Commit the second set of changes

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Create the contributing guide"
   ```

1. (Repeat as necessary)
1. Push the changes to the remote branch

   ```bash
   git push -u origin update-readme
   ```

## Staging All Files

Staging all available files is a popular, though risky, operation. This can save
time, but the risks are two-fold:

### Poorly Thought-Out History

By staging all available changes, the clarity of your history will likely
suffer. Being able to shape your history is one of the greatest advantages of
using Git. If your commits are too large, contain unrelated changes, or are
unclearly described in the commit message, you will lose the benefits of viewing
and changing history.

### Accidentally Committing Files

By using an option to add all files at once, you may accidentally stage and
commit a file that isn't ready. Most common flags don't add files tracked in the
`.gitignore` file. However, any file not listed in the `.gitignore` file will be
staged and committed. This applies to large binary files, and files containing
sensitive information like passwords or authentication tokens.

### Deciding to Stage All Files

If the time is right to stage all files, there are several commands that you can
choose from. As always, it's very important to know what you are staging and
committing.

| Command      | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `git add -A` | Stage **all** files                    |
| `git add .`  | Stage the entire directory recursively |
| `git add -u` | Stage modified and deleted files only  |

|              | New | Modified | Deleted | This Directory | Parent Directories |
| ------------ | --- | -------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| `git add -A` | Yes | Yes      | Yes     | Yes            | Yes                |
| `git add .`  | Yes | Yes      | Yes     | Yes            | No                 |
| `git add -u` | No  | Yes      | Yes     | Yes            | Yes                |

## Stage a Folder or Specific File

The safest and clearest way to use `git add` is by designating the specific file
or directory to be staged. The syntax for this could look like:

| Command              | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `git add directory/` | Stage all changes to all files within a directory |
| `git add README.md`  | Stage all changes within the `README.md` file     |

## Undo Staged Files

Before undoing a `git add`, you should first be sure that you won't lose any
work. There's no way to "revert" an add in the same way you can revert a commit,
but you can move the files out of the staging area.

For example, if you have a staged file, and then you make more changes to that
file in your working directory. Now, the versions in your working directory and
your staging area are different. If you take action to remove the changed
version of the file from the staging area, the changes that were in your working
directory _but not_ staged will be overwritten.

To avoid this, first stage all changes, then unstage them together, or commit
the changes and reset back before the commit happened.

### `git reset`

`git reset` is a flexible and powerful command. One of its many use cases is to
move changes _out_ of the staging area. To do this, use the "mixed" level of
reset (this is the default).

To move staged changes from the staging area to the working directory without
affecting committed history, first make sure that you don't have any additional
changes to the files in question as mentioned above. Then, use the following
command:

```bash
git reset HEAD

# This is the same as:
git reset --mixed HEAD
```
