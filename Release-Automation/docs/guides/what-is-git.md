# What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control software. Version control is a way to save
changes over time without overwriting previous versions. Being distributed means
that every developer working with a Git repository has a copy of that entire
repository – every commit, every branch, every file. If you're used to working
with centralized version control systems, this is a big difference!

Whether or not you've worked with version control before, there are a few things
you should know before getting started with Git:

- Branches are lightweight and cheap, so it's OK to have many of them
- Git stores changes in SHA hashes, which work by compressing text files. That
  makes Git a very good version control system (VCS) for software programming,
  but not so good for binary files like images or videos.
- Git repositories can be connected, so you can work on one locally on your own
  machine, and connect it to a shared repository. This way, you can
  [push](./git-push.md) and [pull](./git-pull.md) changes to a repository and
  easily collaborate with others.

## What is Git Written in?

The tools that make up the core Git distribution are written in C, Shell, Perl,
and Tcl. You can find Git's source code on GitHub under
[git/git](https://github.com/git/git).

## Why Use Git?

Version control is very important – without it, you risk losing your work. With
Git, you can make a "commit", or a save point, as often as you'd like. You can
also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while
you're working. Commit often and commit early, and you'll never have that
gut-sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes.

There are many version control systems out there – but Git has some major
advantages.

### Speed

Like we mentioned above, Git uses SHA compression, which makes it very fast.

### Merge conflicts

Git can handle merge conflicts, which means that **it's OK for multiple people
to work on the same file at the same time**. This opens up the world of
development in a way that isn't possible with centralized version control. You
have access to the entire project, and if you're working on a branch, you can do
whatever you need to and know that your changes are safe.

### Cheap branches

Speaking of branches, Git offers a lot of flexibility and opportunity for
collaboration with branches. **By using branches, developers can make changes in
a safe sandbox.**

Instead of only committing code that is 100% sure to succeed, developers can
commit code that might still need help. Then, they can push that code to the
remote and get fast feedback from integrated tests or peer review.

Without sharing the code through branches, this would never be possible.

### Ease of roll back

If you make a mistake, it's OK! Commits are immutable, meaning they can't be
changed. (**Note:** You _can_ change history, but it will create new replacement
commits instead of editing the existing commits. More on that later!_) This
means that if you do make a mistake, even on an important branch, like `main`,
it's \_OK_. **You can easily revert that change, or roll back the branch pointer
to the commit where everything was fine.**

The benefits of this can't be overstated. Not only does it create a safer
environment for the project and code, but it fosters a development environment
where developers can be braver, trusting that Git has their back.

## How Do I Use Git?

### Learning Git Basics

If you're getting started with Git, a great place to learn the basic commands is
the [Git Cheat sheet](https://github.github.io/training-kit/). It's translated
into many languages,
[open source as a part of the `github/training-kit` repository](https://github.com/github/training-kit),
and a great starting place for the fundamentals on the command line.

Some of the most important and most used commands that you'll find there are:

- `git clone [url]`: [Clone](./git-clone.md) (download) a repository that
  already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits.
- `git status`: Always a good idea, this command shows you what branch you're
  on, what files are in the working or staging directory, and any other
  important information.
- `git branch`: This shows the existing branches in your local repository. You
  can also use `git branch [branch-name]` to create a branch from your current
  location, or `git branch --all` to see all branches, both the local ones on
  your machine, and the remote tracking branches stored from the last `git pull`
  or `git fetch` from the remote.
- `git checkout [branch-name]`: Switches to the specified branch and updates the
  working directory.
- `git add [file]`: Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning, adding it
  to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "descriptive message"`: Records file snapshots permanently in
  the version history.
- `git pull`: Updates your current local working branch with all new commits
  from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. `git pull` is a combination of
  `git fetch` and `git merge`.
- `git push`: Uploads all local branch commits to the remote.
- `git log`: Browse and inspect the evolution of project files.
- `git remote -v`: Show the associated remote repositories and their stored
  name, like `origin`.

### Getting Started With the Git Workflow

Depending on your operating system, you may already have
[Git installed](./install-git.md). But, getting started means more than having
the software! To get started, it's important to know the basics of how Git
works. You may choose to do the actual work within a terminal, an app like
GitHub Desktop, or through GitHub.com. (_Note: while you can interact with Git
through GitHub.com, your experience may be limited. Many local tools can give
you access to the most widely used Git functionalities, though only the terminal
will give you access to them all._)

#### Create a branch

The main branch is usually called `main`. We want to work on _another_ branch,
so we can make a pull request and make changes safely. To get started, create a
branch off of `main`. Name it however you'd like – but we recommend naming
branches based on the function or feature that will be the focus of this branch.
One person may have several branches, and one branch may have several people
collaborate on it – branches are for a purpose, not a person. Wherever you
currently "are" (wherever HEAD is pointing, or whatever branch you're currently
"checked out" to) will be the parent of the branch you create. That means you
can create branches from other branches, tags, or any commit! But, the most
typical workflow is to create a branch from `main` – which represents the most
current production code.

#### Make changes (and make a commit)

Once you've created a branch, and moved the HEAD pointer to it by "checking out"
to that branch, you're ready to get to work. Make the changes in your repository
using your favorite text editor or IDE.

Next, save your changes. You're ready to start the commit!

To start your [commit](./git-commit.md), you need to let Git know what changes
you'd like to include with `git add [file]`.

Once you've saved and staged the changes, you're ready to
[make the commit](./git-commit.md) with
`git commit -m "descriptive commit message"`.

#### Push your changes to the remote

So far, if you've made a commit locally, you're the only one that can see it. To
let others see your work and begin collaboration, you should "push" your changes
using `git push`. If you're pushing from a branch for the first time that you've
created locally, you may need to give Git some more information.
`git push -u origin [branch-name]` tells Git to push the current branch, and
create a branch on the remote that matches it with the same name – and also,
create a relationship with that branch so that `git push` will be enough
information in the future.

By default, `git push` only pushes the branch that you've currently checked out
to.

Sometimes, if there has been a new commit on the branch on the _remote_, you may
be blocked from pushing. Don't worry! Start with a simple
[`git pull`](./git-pull.md) to incorporate the changes on the remote into your
own local branch, resolve any conflicts or finish the merge from the remote into
the local branch, and then try the push again.

#### Open a pull request

Pushing a branch, or new commits, to a remote repository is enough if a pull
request already exists, but if it's the first time you're pushing that branch,
you should open a new pull request. A pull request is a comparison of two
branches – typically `main`, or the branch that the feature branch was created
from, and the feature branch. This way, like branches, pull requests are scoped
around a specific function or addition of work, rather than the person making
the changes or the amount of time the changes will take.

Pull requests are the powerhouse of GitHub. Integrated tests can automatically
run on pull requests, giving you immediate feedback on your code. Peers can give
detailed code reviews, letting you know if there are changes to make, or if it's
ready to go.

Make sure you start your pull requests off with the right information. Put
yourself in the shoes of your teammates, or even of your future self. Include
information about what this change relates to, what prompted it, what is already
done, what is left to do, and any specific asks for help or reviews. Include
links to relevant work or conversations. Pull request templates can help make
this process easy by automating the starting content of the body of pull
requests.

#### Collaborate

Once the pull request is open, then the real fun starts. It's important to
recognize that pull requests aren't meant to be open when work is _finished_.
Pull requests should be open when work is _beginning_! The earlier you open a
pull request, the more visibility the entire team has to the work that you're
doing. When you're ready for feedback, you can get it by integrating tests or
requesting reviews from teammates.

It's very likely that you will want to make more changes to your work. That's
great! To do that, make more commits on the same branch. Once the new commits
are present on the remote, the pull request will update and show the most recent
version of your work.

#### Merge into `main`

Once you and your team decide that the pull request looks good, you can merge
it. By merging, you integrate the feature branch into the other branch (most
typically the `main` branch). Then, `main` will be updated with your changes,
and your pull request will be closed. Don't forget to delete your branch! You
won't need it anymore. Remember, branches are lightweight and cheap, and you
should create a new one when you need it based on the most recent commit on the
`main` branch.

If you choose not to merge the pull request, you can also close pull requests
with unmerged changes.

### Getting Started With GitHub

If you're wondering where Git ends and GitHub begins, you're not alone. They are
tied closely together to make working with them both a seamless experience.
While Git takes care of the underlying version control, GitHub is the
collaboration platform built on top of it. GitHub is the place for pull
requests, comments, reviews, integrated tests, and so much more. Most developers
work locally to develop and use GitHub for collaboration. That ranges from using
GitHub to host the shared remote repository to working with colleagues and
capitalizing on features like protected branches, code review, GitHub Actions,
and more.
