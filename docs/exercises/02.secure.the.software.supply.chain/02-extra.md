# :test_tube: Extra: Packing The Application

!!! quote ":octicons-milestone-16: Packing The Application"

    > In this step we will containerize the application using Docker and push to GitHub Container Registry.


    !!! Note
        We will continue working on the same branch `continuous-deployment`.

    1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and open the file `3.extra.container.image.packaging.yml`.
    2. Add the following content to the file:

        !!! example "Package Delivery Artifacts"

            ```yaml
            --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/04.docker.yml"
            ```

        !!! example "Push changes to Github"

            ```bash
            git add .
            git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - push Docker image to GitHub Packages"
            git push origin continuous-deployment
            ```

    ---

    - Navigate to the repository on GitHub and open a pull request.
    - After the workflow is finished, navigate to the [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry) and verify that the container image was pushed successfully.
