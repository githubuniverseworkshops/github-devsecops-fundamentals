# :test_tube: Continues Deployment

In this part we will get our application ready for deployment and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

- _**Objectives:**_ Create a new pre-release version (tag) of the application when our main branch is updated.
- _**Estimated completion time:**_ 5 minutes
- _**Outcome:**_ A new pre-release version of the application is created when the main branch is updated.

!!! note
    This step will not be run until we merge the pull request first

## :pencil: Lab

### 1. Create a GitHub Action to build and publish the application

!!! note
    We will keep working on the same branch `contiuous-integration-deployment`.

#### Step 1: Get the last version number

1. Navgiate to `.github/workflows` and create a new file called `02.1.continuous.delivery.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the file:
!!! example "Get Version Number"

      ```yaml
      --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/02.continuous-deployment-part-1.yml"
      ```

!!! example "Push changes to Github"
       ``` bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add security checks step"
       git push origin continuous-integration-deployment
       ```

#### Step 2: Get next version number

1. Navgiate to `.github/workflows` and open `02.1.continuous.delivery.yml`.
2. On line `24` add the following content:
!!! example "Get Next Version Number"

      ```yaml
      --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/02.continuous-deployment-part-2.yml"
      ```

!!! example "Push changes to Github"
       ``` bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add security checks step"
       git push origin continuous-integration-deployment
       ```

#### Step 3: Create tag for the next version for pre-release

1. Navgiate to `.github/workflows` and open `02.1.continuous.delivery.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the file after line `38`:
!!! example "Create pre-release tag"

      ```yaml
      --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/02.continuous-deployment-part-3.yml"
      ```

!!! example "Push changes to Github"
       ``` bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add security checks step"
       git push origin continuous-integration-deployment
       ```
