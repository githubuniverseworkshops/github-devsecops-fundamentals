!!! quote ":octicons-milestone-16: Continuous Delivery"

    > In this part we will get our application ready for deployment and then deploy it to GitHub Pages.

    !!! note
        This step will not be run until we merge the pull request first

    ### 1. Create a GitHub Action to build and publish the application

    !!! note
        We will keep working on the same branch `continuous-deployment`.

    #### Step 1: Get the last version number

    1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and create a new file called `2.1.continuous.delivery.yml`.
    2. Use this worklow to:
        1. Get the last version number
        2. Get the next version number
        3. Create a tag for the next version for release
    3. Add the following content to the file:

        !!! example "Continuous Delivery Workflow"

            ```yaml
            --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/02.continuous-delivery.yml"
            ```

        !!! example "Push changes to Github"

            ```bash
            git add .
            git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add continuous-Delivery"
            git push origin continuous-deployment
            ```
