# :test_tube: Continues Deployment

In this part we will get our application ready for deployment and then deploy it to GitHub Pages.

- _**Objectives:**_ Create a new release version (tag) of the application when our main branch is updated.
- _**Estimated completion time:**_ 5 minutes

## :pencil: Lab

### 1. Create a GitHub Action to build and publish the application

!!! note
    We will keep working on the same branch `continuous-deployment`.

#### Step 1: Get the last version number

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and create a new file called `02.1.continuous.delivery.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the file:

    !!! example "Get Version Number"

        ```yaml
        --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/02.continuous-deployment-part-1.yml"
        ```

    !!! example "Push changes to Github"

        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add continuous-deployment part 1"
        git push origin continuous-deployment
        ```

#### Step 2: Get next version number

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and open `02.1.continuous.delivery.yml`.
2. On line `24` add the following content:

    !!! example "Get Next Version Number"

        ```yaml
        --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/02.continuous-deployment-part-2.yml"
        ```

    !!! example "Push changes to Github"

        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add continuous-deployment part 2"
        git push origin continuous-deployment
        ```

#### Step 3: Create tag for the next version for release

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and open `02.1.continuous.delivery.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the file after line `38`:

    !!! example "Create release tag"

        ```yaml
        --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/02.continuous-deployment-part-3.yml"
        ```

    !!! example "Push changes to Github"

        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add continuous-deployment part 3"
        git push origin continuous-deployment
        ```
