!!! quote ":octicons-milestone-16: Add Security Checks"

    > In this part we will add to the continuous integration workflow the security checks which be run on the Pull Request open event.

!!! note

    - We are continuing work on the PR created from branch `feature/tetris-game`.
    - You should have completed the [base security configuration prerequisite](../../prerequisites.md#configure-base-security).

## Exercise: Implement dependency review as automated security check

:material-numeric-1-circle: Open `.github/workflows/continuous.integration.yml` in the file explorer.

---

:material-numeric-2-circle: Add the {== highlighted ==} content into the `.github/workflows/continuous.integration.yml` file:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/continuous.integration.yml" linenums="1" hl_lines="67-76"
--8<-- "reference.implementations/workflows/1.3.continuous.integration.yml"
```

---

:material-numeric-3-circle: Push your changes to Github

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add security checks step"
git push origin feature/tetris-game
```

:material-numeric-4-circle: Navigate to the repository on GitHub and open the existing pull request to observe the outcome of the newly added check. As the check is currently successful you should not see any remarkable new difference in the checks reporting, yet.
