# :test_tube: Security Checks

!!! quote ":octicons-milestone-16: Add Security Checks"

    > In this part we will add to the continuous integration workflow the security checks which be run on the Pull Request open event.


    !!! note
        We will continue working on the same branch `feature/tetris-game` and the same file `1.1.continuous.integration.yml`.

    ### Step 1. Enable GHAS (GitHub Advanced Security) checks on GitHub Repository

    !!! note
        - You must have admin permissions on the repository to perform this step.
        - This part is suppose to be done in the prerequisites
        - Change the indentation settings to use 2 spaces

    ### Step 2. Add security checks to the continuous integration workflow

    1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and open the file `01.1.continuous.integration.yml`.
    2. Add the following content to the file:

        !!! example "Security Checks"

            ```yaml
            --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/01.continuous-integration-part-1.yml"
            ```

        !!! example "Push changes to Github"

            ``` bash
            git add .
            git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add security checks step"
            git push origin feature/tetris-game
            ```

    Navigate to the repository on GitHub and open the pull request.
