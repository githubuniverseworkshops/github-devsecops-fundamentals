!!! quote ":octicons-milestone-16: Build and Upload Application Artifact"

    > In this step we will build the application and upload the artifact to GitHub Packages once the release tag is created on step [Create Tag Step](./01.md).


    !!! note
        We will continue working on the same branch `continuous-deployment`.

    1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and create a new file with name `2.2.continuous.delivery.yml`.
    2. On this step will build the application and upload the artifact to GitHub Packages as following:
        1. Build and Archive Artifact
        2. Draft The Release
        3. Upload and Publish The Release
    3. Add the following content to the file `2.2.continuous.delivery.yml`:

    !!! example "Build and Archive Artifact"

        ```yaml
        --8<-- "docs/exercises/02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/workflows/03.continuous.delivery.yml"
        ```

    !!! example "Push changes to Github"

        ``` bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: add continuous delivery workflow for building and publishing the application"
        git push origin continuous-deployment
        ```
