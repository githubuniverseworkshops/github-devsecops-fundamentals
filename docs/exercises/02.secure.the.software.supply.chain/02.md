!!! note

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and open the file `02.2.continuous.delivery.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the file:
!!! example "Package Delivery Artifacts"

        name: Package Delivery Artifacts
        on:
          push:
            tags:
              - "*pre-release*"
        permissions:
          contents: read
          packages: write
          pages: write
        env:
          CI: true
          SITE_DIR: _site
        jobs:
          package-delivery:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - name: Setup GitHub Pages
              uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
              with:
                token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              enablement: "true"
            - name: Build Site
              run: |
                python -m mkdocs build --clean --strict --verbose --site-dir '${{ env.SITE_DIR }}'
            - name: Create Pre-Release
              uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
              with:
                files: ${{ env.SITE_DIR }}
                prerelease: true
                generate_release_notes: true
                fail_on_unmatched_files: true
                discussion_category_name: Announcements
      ```
