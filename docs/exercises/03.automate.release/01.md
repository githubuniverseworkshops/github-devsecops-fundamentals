# :test_tube: Deploy the application to GitHub Pages

In this step once we clarify the application is ready to be deployed to release we will create a new release deployment.

- _**Objective:**_ Create a new release deployment.
- _**Estimated completion time:**_ 5 minutes
- _**Outcome:**_ A production release will be created.

!!! note
    We will continue working on the same branch `continuous-deployment`.

## :books: Resources

- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## :pencil: Lab

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and open the file `03.continuous.deployment.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the file:

    !!! example "Deploy Release"

        ```yaml
        --8<-- "docs/exercises/03.automate.release/workflows/01.continuous-deployment.yml"
        ```

    !!! example "Push changes to Github"

        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: update continuous integration workflow - add security checks step"
        git push origin continuous-deployment
        ```

## :star: Recap

So far, we have reached the following milestones:

1. Enable Security Features and checks on [Step](../02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/00.md).
2. Create a new release tag on [Step](../02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/01.md).
3. Build and Upload Application Artifact on [Step](../02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/02.md).
4. Container Image Packaging on [Step](../02.secure.the.software.supply.chain/02-extra.md).
5. Create a new release deployment.

Now let's move to our final step by merging the pull request to main branch on [Step](02.md) and test all of the steps above.
