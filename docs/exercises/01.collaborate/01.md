# :test_tube: Project Management

!!! quote ":octicons-project-16: Facilitate collaborative tracking of business goal delivery"

    > _As part of the prerequisite steps, you had created a project management board. You will now build on that step and keep stakeholders in the loop through the full course of the development process._

    1. Refer back to the project created in the [prerequisite to the workshop](../../prerequisites.md#create-a-project-board-for-the-repository)

    2. Create an issue (1) to capture the goal
    { .annotate }

          1. 👀 See [Project planning for developers](https://github.com/features/issues) to learn more.

          <!-- end annotation -->

          1. Select the **:octicons-project-16: Backlog** view
          2. Click on the **+ Add item**
          3. Click on the **+** button
          4. Select **:octicons-issue-opened-16: Create new issue** from the menu
          5. Choose the repository you created earlier
          6. Choose **Feature request** (1)
             { .annotate }

             1. The issue creation was facilitated with an 👀 [**issue template**](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates#issue-templates).

                ```markdown title=".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md"
                --8<-- ".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md"
                ```

          7. Fill the form as follows or feel free to be creative 🙂 with your inputs.

             After filling the form, click <span class="gh-button-green">Create <span style="font-size: 0.75em">:material-apple-keyboard-command::material-keyboard-return:</span></span> to create the issue. (1)
             { .annotate }

             1. Things you can do in an issue include but are not limited to
                - [**Assign**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users) the issue to yourself or other stakeholders.
                - [**Mention**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) other stakeholders (people and teams) to notify them for awareness.

    You may now update the issue with comments to keep collaborating stakeholders in the loop.
