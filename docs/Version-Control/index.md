# Version Control

Software development may be approached individually or collaboratively. In
either case, there is a basic need for accessible, scalable storage for project
files, and the ability to track the evolution of the project.

`git` helps track project files and assets as they change over time, giving
transparency to different points in the history of the software development and
enabling easy switches across those points.
