    > _Our goal is to create a **Tetris Game** to delight our site visitors._

    1. Refer back to the Codespaces development environment created in the [prerequisite to the workshop](../../../#prerequisites).
    2. On the `TERMINAL` view at the bottom, notice that a local site server is already running.
    3. On the `PORTS` view at the bottom, notice there is a `Site (8080)` entry in the table. You may right click on the entry to make the port public.
    4. Click the **:octicons-globe-16:** icon associated with `Site (8080)` entry to view the site in your browser
    5. Find and open the file `mkdocs.yml` in the File Explorer (it's at the root of the file tree)
    6. Uncomment the Tetris Game relevant entry and point the value of the entry to the `.Tetris-Game` folder

    7. Observe the local build in the terminal and do a manual test of the integration
    8. Add automated checks by duplicating `.github.reference/workflows/01.1.continuous.integration.yml` into `.github/workflows/01.1.continuous.integration.yml`
