> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step requires the previous step [Create Tag Step](../01.md) to be completed first and the pre-realse tag is created and merging the pull request to main branch on step [Merge Pull Request Step](../04.md).

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and open the file `02.2.continuous.delivery.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the file:

    ```yml
        name: Package Delivery Artifacts

        on:
        push:
            tags:
            - "*pre-release*"
        workflow_dispatch: {}

        permissions:
        contents: read
        packages: write
        pages: write

        env:
        CI: 1
        SITE_DIR: _site

        jobs:
        package-delivery:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - name: Checkout
                uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Setup GitHub Pages
                uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
                with:
                token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                enablement: "true"
            - name: Build Site
                run: |
                mkdocs build --clean --strict --verbose --site-dir '${{ env.SITE_DIR }}'
            - name: Create Pre-Release
                uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
                with:
                files: ${{ env.SITE_DIR }}
                prerelease: true
                generate_release_notes: true
                fail_on_unmatched_files: true
                discussion_category_name: Announcements
    ```

3. Save the file and commit the changes to the branch `continuous-integration-deployment`.

    ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Build and upload application artifact"
        git push origin continuous-integration-deployment
    ```

4. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
