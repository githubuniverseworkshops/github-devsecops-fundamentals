# Deploye the application to GitHub Pages

In this step once we clarify the application is ready to be deployed to pre-relase we will create a new release deployment.

- _**Objective:**_ Create a new release deployment.
- _**Estimated completion time:**_ 5 minutes
- _**Outcome:**_ A production release will be created.

> [!NOTE]
> We will continue working on the same branch `contiuous-integration-deployment`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step requires the previous step [Create pre-release Step](../02.md) to be completed first and the pre-realse tag is created and merging the pull request to main branch on step [Merge Pull Request Step](../04.md).

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and open the file `03.continuous.deployment.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the file:

    ```yml
        name: Deploy Release

        on:
        release:
            types:
            - released
        workflow_dispatch: {}

        concurrency:
        group: production-deployment
        cancel-in-progress: false

        permissions:
        packages: none
        contents: write
        issues: write
        deployments: write

        env:
        CI: 1

        jobs:
        deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            environment:
            name: production
            url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.site-url }}

            steps:
            - name: Download release
                run: |
                curl -o assets.zip ${{ github.event.release.assets_url }}
                # unarchive asset

            - name: Deploy
                run: |
                # do git configs
                git push origin HEAD:gh-pages

            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
                with:
                node-version: 20
            - name: Install NodeJS dependencies
                run: npm ci
            - name: Install Playwright Browsers
                run: npx playwright install --with-deps
            - name: Run post-deployment UI test
                run: |
                # 1. disable automatic run of webserver by test framework
                # 2. set baseurl to ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.site-url }}
                npx playwright test
                # env:
                #   TETRIS_APP_HOST: "127.0.0.1"
                #   TETRIS_APP_PORT: "8000"
                #   TETRIS_APP_PATH: "pages/githubuniverseworkshops/github-devsecops-fundamentals"
        ```

3. Save the file and commit the changes to the branch `continuous-integration-deployment`.

    ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: add deployment workflow"
        git push origin continuous-integration-deployment
    ```

## :star: Recap

In this module we have created:

1. Enable Security Features and checks on [Step](../00.md).
2. Create a new pre-release tag on [Step](../01.md).
3. Build and Upload Application Artifact on [Step](../02.md).
4. Container Image Packaging on [Step](../02-extra.md).
5. Create a new release deployment on [Step](../03.md).

Now let's move to our final step by merging the pull request to main branch on [Step](../04.md) and test all of the steps above.
